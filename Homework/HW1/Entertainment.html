                <p><strong>SMART TV</strong></p>
               <p><br>Another electronic device used in most peoples lives almost everyday are Smart TVs. Advances in TV <br>
                technology are due to them having computers inside making them almost half TV half Computer. As usual, there<br>
                must be code written to give these newer TVs the "smarts" is you will. Samsung smart TVs are said to use<br>
                multible coding launguages to create apps which include Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Streaming TV also needs<br>
                code to make such a feature possible. It depeands on which provider you use for your Streaming TV, but one <br>
                service Amazon FireTV uses the Android OS which is Java and XML based.</p>

                <p><strong>VIDEO GAMES</strong></p>
                <p><br>Video games are the last technology used almost daily covered in my website. They are becoming more <br>
                and more advanced these days and they too need coding to make them run because the consoles are basically <br>
                a computer with its own Operating system, or are made to be played on a PC or MAC. Big console games are <br>
                developed in C++, with C and Assembly for low-level engine modules. Graphics is supplemented with Cg/HLSL - <br>
                shader videoprocessor code within OpenGL or DirectX frameworks. There is also Matrix Math involved with making<br>
                graphics and as computers become more advanced so to does the ability to make better graphics for video games.</p>
